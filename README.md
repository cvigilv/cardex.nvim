My personal note-taking system.

## Phylosophy

Build upon good tools to build a nice note taking system, that is:

- Use `marksman` LSP as base
- Add nice search capabilities
- Add links navigator
- Add tags navigator
- Add tasks navigatos
- Add contacts navigator

## On development

This is my personal note-taking system, therefore I'll only add things I think could directly
help me improve this system. Please don't assume this will work for you out-of-box, this is a
ever chaning plugin that aims to maximize my own experience with how I take notes and how I like
to interact with this.

Think of this as a starting point for developng you own PKM plugin more than a plug-and-play
plugin.
